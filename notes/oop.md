## 4 pillars
Abstraction-Data Hiding
Encapsulation-method+variables ko wrap karna
Inheritance-child class/parent class
Polymorphism-many forms but same name

## Prototype

js has a quality to investigate in layers 
this is called prototypal inheritance
every data structure points to object almost and then to null
data_structure->object->null
