Async code
js-synchronus(sequential),single threaded(ek hi thread par sb kuch hota h)
js engine is always found with browser or runtime environemnt 
this is default behaviour

execution context
->execute one line of coede at a time
->eg-console log 1
->console log 2
//here,each operations waits for the last one to complete before executing next one(single thread)

Blocking code(blocks the flow of Program,Read file sync)
Non Blocking Code(Does not block execution,read file async)
the above two are used according to the use cases
